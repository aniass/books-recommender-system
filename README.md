# Books Recommendation System

## General info
The project concerns the books recommendation system. It includes data analysis, data preparation and explored three kind of recommendations - the simplest recommendations, content-based filtering and collaborative filtering (by KNN model and matrix factorization). The final result will show that the user can input one book's name or author then the system can provide the other most possible books that he can to read.

### Dataset
In our analysis we used two datasets come from Kaggle: [Goodreads books](https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks) and [Google Books](https://www.kaggle.com/bilalyussef/google-books-dataset). 

## Motivation
The Recommendation System is based on previous (past) behaviours, it predicts the likelihood that a user would prefer an item. Many of applications for example Netflix uses recommendation system. It suggests people new movies according to their past activities that are like watching and voting movies. The purpose of a book recommendation system is to predict buyerâ€™s interest and recommend books to them respectively. That system can take into regard many parameters like book content and quality by filtering user reviews.
